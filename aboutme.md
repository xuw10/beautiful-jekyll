- Processed trial dataset of China A-shares stocks&#39; factors, and calculated the quintile and MVO (mean-variance

optimization) factor returns, to identify the best factors for highest Sharpe Ratios

- Performed the stock factor dimension reduction by rdecreasingducing the  number from 400 factors by 85%, with only 10% loss in

data variance; . This improvedhelps  prediction of future stock performance based on the 60 composite factors

_Financial Sentimental Factors with Natural Language Processing:_

- Trained the corpus with _word2vec_ and calculated the morphological and semantics similarities of all words in each piece

- Generated the user-to-product affinity scores based on matrix factorization with singular-value-decomposition (SVD)

**Media Assembly,** Los Angeles,USA

**Data Scientist,** Mar 2017 – Mar 2018

_Movie Recommendation with Collaborative Metric Learning_ _and Natural Language Processing__:_
